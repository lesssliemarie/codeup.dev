	<h2>My Favorite Quote:</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<em>"Death from disillusion is not instantaneous, and there are no mercy killers for the disillusioned. Because when those who seek to help you merely indicate that you are dreaming, that you are caught in illusion, you can answer truthfully: I am planning and designing the future."</em> - Anais Nin
