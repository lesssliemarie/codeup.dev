What helped me most was showing up to events and networking. The last Web Dev meetup wasn't the greatest since it was on SEO/Social Media, but the next will be on frameworks. I'd also suggest going to the PHP meetup, even the programmers book club if you can. Basically, check the Geekdom events page all the time if there's anything programming related, go! You won't understand everything they're talking about but you'll meet people and you'll get exposed to things; both are HUGE advantages.   What also really helped was being exposed to/understanding higher level concepts about programming and how things work as a whole. For instance, what is client side versus server side. How a URL is broken down and what information it sends, how that information travels. Here's a link to a good visual that breaks down the different languages and such and where they fall in the web spectrum: http://alpha.ideavis.co/529cc5f  I met my main mentor, Tex, at a Web Dev meetup. He was kind enough to meet with me once a week for an hour and introduce some major concepts to me. We went over basic logic, etc. It was REALLY helpful. I'd be happy to introduce you to him and see if he might be able to do at least a couple tutoring type sessions with you?   TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LIVESTREAM. Its on every day. If you're free and at your computer while we're here working, I would totally watch it!  Do all of the Codecademy courses (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP). And try to take notes and really understand why/how things work. Try to build little things, too!

And try to take notes and really understand why/how things work. Try to build little things, too!   We've spent the majority of our time doing PHP thus far. I would say getting familiar with front-end/client side is important to do on your own since they aren't going into much depth with that. So taking more time to learn HTML/CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. I would certainly try building at least one website using Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com). Just to get familiar with that framework since its what we're using in here.   Biggest advice I have though is to not panic/stress or worry much about if you 100% understand all the information you're trying to take in. Most of this stuff won't sink until the 3rd, 4th, 5th, shoot maybe even the 20th time you do it. BUT, exposing yourself to as much as possible, even if 95% of it goes over your head, will help. Because down the line they'll start talking about something and you'll say to yourself "Ohhhh I remember seeing that when I did Codecademy and Ohhhh that's what it actually means or how it actually works." The lightbulb WILL go off, eventually :)  So don't get flustered!   I'm more than happy to meet with you evenings or weekends to help explain things, too!
